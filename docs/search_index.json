[["index.html", "Computational Phylogenetics: A Hands-on Tutorial Welcome", " Computational Phylogenetics: A Hands-on Tutorial Mingyu Yuan 2022-05-13 Welcome ðŸ‘‹ Hi! This tutorial is largely inspired by Prof.Â Andrew Garrettâ€™s class (LING230 Advanced Historical Linguistics, Spring 2022) and Edwin Koâ€™s past and current work on computational phylogenetics. I am deeply grateful to both of them. All errors are my own. The purposes of this tutorial are three-fold. First, to briefly summarize the past and present of computational phylogenetics, providing an overview of computatioanl methods applied in this line of research. Second, to introduce Bayesian phylogenetics and relevant details, including trait selection, data format and coding scheme, and existing software and packages. Lastly, to give a step-by-step tutorial of implementing Bayesian-MCMC method in command lines with Beastling. Ko (2021)â€™s analysis of the phylogeny of Siouan is reproduced in Section 3. This tutorial does require basic understandings of historical linguistic terms, though wiki links or relevant introductory materials are provided whenever a term is mentioned. This tutorial does not assume or require any programming background though. The .R file used to preprocess data is available in the project repository. Command line basics are introduced in Section 3. This tutorial is written in Markdown and compiled by Bookdown.

Notes: I use traits, features, and characters interchangeably throughout the tutorial. The first two sections are highly-condensed summaries of computational phylogenetics. See Nichols and Warnow (2008), Dunn (2015), Bowern (2018), and JÃ¤ger (2019) for general introductions to computational phylogenetics; also see Hoffmann et al. (2021) for a tutorial of implementing Bayesian phylogenetcis in BEAST.
